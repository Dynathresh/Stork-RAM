# Stork-RAM
This is Stork-RAM.

Potential issues:
    Storks get used to and ignore pellets over time


Potential alternatives:
    "Some fish farms have been very successful using water jets on a timer. Every 10 minutes or so, a powerful water jet skims over the pond, about a foot off the surface. The herons apparently find being blasted with this stream of water quite annoying and move on."
